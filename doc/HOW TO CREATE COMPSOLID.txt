Ugo, are you creating them independently (e.g. two different calls to BRepPrimAPI_MakeBox) ? If so, there is no sharing inside.
'Sharing' is a topological notion, i.e. an object is 'shared' if it is exactly one memory location pointed to by different objects.

TopTools_MapOfShape (or any other container using TopTools_ShapeMapHasher for key generation) uses TopoDS_Shape::IsSame() which returns true for shape with:
- the same TopoDS_TShapes
- the same TopLoc_Locations
- (same or different orientations)

If you really need to have boxes with a shared face, you need to create them bottom-up. Or perhaps try the following:
- create first box
- explore by faces and find the right one (order is always predefined)
- create 2nd box
- find the face which corresponds to one to be shared
- use BRepTools_ReShape to record substitution of face2 with face1
- BRepTools_ReShape::Apply (box2) will return you a box with face1 inside.
- create a compound.

Hope this helps.
