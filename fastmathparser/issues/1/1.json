    "Description": "I love this as a solution, but I have a problem. I want to create several solvers in several different object files. However, because you have your entire implementation in a single header, linking multiple object files which include your .hpp file means multiple definition errors in the link stage. We have a solution to mitigate this, but would it be possible to transition this to a .h and .cpp file? Is there a benefit to how you have structured the solution?",
